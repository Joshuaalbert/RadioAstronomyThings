# RadioAstronomyThings
This contains algorithms and tools that I have thought of and had the time to code up, that relate to radio astronomy.

## BeamDeconvolution
Tools that deconvololve gaussian beams, find common beams, and a few other things.

## UniformSelection
Tools for selecting uniformly distributed calibrators from available calibrators.
Requires pybdsm.

## CombineImages
Tool for combining (stacking) images. Regrids, convoles to common beamsize, then weighted averages them. 
Requires beam doconvolution.
